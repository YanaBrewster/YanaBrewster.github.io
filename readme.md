### About Me
---
I believe UX/UI design and front-end web development are crucial tools for solving problems in today's technological world. For this reason, I am also very interested in website accessibility and am keen to learn more about it and incorporate it in future case studies.

I love the process of designing and creating websites. The satisfaction of delivering a complete project that fulfills the users' needs is what I enjoy most about web design. My curious, gentle nature and bicultural upbringing enable me to relate to and empathise with a diverse range of people from different backgrounds and cultures. This perspective allows me to sense other people's needs and wants intuitively and this drives me to find solutions to their problems. Having a flair for design strengthens my ability to answer the user’s problem visually, in a user-friendly and effective way.

In my next role, I want to build on my current skill set by refining my user experience knowledge and technique, or sharpen my coding skills and learn new coding languages.
